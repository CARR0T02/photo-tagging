# Photo Tagging App

This project is built using React, TypeScript, Tailwind, and Firebase.

The main objective of this application is to recreate the concept of the popular game "Where's Waldo." Users are required to search for specific characters displayed in the sidebar within the given photo.

Unlike traditional styling methods like Sass, this project utilizes Tailwind CSS and incorporates the Flowbite framework to enhance the user interface. By combining these technologies, the app aims to provide a visually appealing and interactive experience for users.
