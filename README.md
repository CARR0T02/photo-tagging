# Photo Tagging App

This project is to practice the use of a back end service, in this case, Firebase.

The main objective of this web application is to recreate the concept of the popular game "Where's Waldo." Users are required to search for specific characters displayed in the sidebar within the given photo. Firebase is used to store the images and locations of all the characters.

Unlike most of the other projects where I used Sass to style them, this project utilizes Tailwind CSS and incorporates the Flowbite UI component library to enhance the user interface. By combining these technologies, the app aims to provide a visually appealing and interactive experience for users.
